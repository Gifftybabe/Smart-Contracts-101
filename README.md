# Smart-Contracts-101: Beginner Smart Contracts  
**A repository to document my journey of learning and mastering the foundations of Solidity and smart contract development.**  

---

## 🛠️ About This Repository  
This repository contains beginner-friendly smart contract projects as I revisit the foundational concepts of Solidity and blockchain development. Whether you're new to Solidity or brushing up on the basics, this repo serves as a step-by-step guide to understanding and writing smart contracts.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure  
The projects are organized in folders with each folder containing:  
- **Smart Contract Code**: Written in Solidity (.sol files).  
- **README**: Detailed explanation of the contract, its purpose, and how it works.  
- **Test Files**: Test scripts for verifying the contract's functionality (where applicable).  
- **Deployment Files**: Hardhat or Foundry scripts for deploying the contracts.

## 🚀 Projects in This Repository  
1. **HelloWorld.sol**: A simple contract to understand basic syntax and functions.  
2. **SimpleStorage.sol**: A contract for storing and retrieving data.  
3. **Counter.sol**: A contract demonstrating state variables and functions.  
4. **Bank.sol**: A basic bank contract with deposit, withdraw, and transfer features.  

*More projects will be added as the learning journey progresses.*
